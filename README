Pig UDFs

See source comments for usage.

To setup a development environment:

Install Simple Built Tool (SBT):
---
wget http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-tools.sbt/sbt-launch/0.11.2/sbt-launch.jar
mv -f sbt-launch.jar ~/bin
cat > ~/bin/sbt << "EOF"
java -Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=384M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
EOF
chmod u+x ~/bin/sbt
---

Compile: sbt compile
Package to a JAR: sbt assembly
Add ~ to any command to make a task run whenever a source file is changed.

** If there are any dependency errors, try the 'magic fix' of: rm -rf ~/.ivy2
   If the web dependencies get too annoying, we can also just put pig.jar
   in lib/ and be done with it.
